# Room Geometry

*Placeholder — to be developed*

## Overview

Speaker and listening position geometry for mixing/monitoring.

Note: This is secondary to the drum room function. Primary use is acoustic drums; mixing is a secondary use case.

## Considerations

- Monitor placement relative to walls
- Listening position (if dedicated mixing spot)
- Symmetry requirements
- Reflection points

## Design Decisions

*TBD — may be deferred since mixing is secondary use*
