## Acoustic Considerations

- Recording equipment has specific power requirements (clean power, adequate circuits)
- HVAC requires dedicated circuit(s)
- Outlet placement affects usability - drums, amps, recording gear locations
- Lighting needs: general, task, and potentially dimmable
- Future-proofing: extra capacity for equipment additions
- Electrical boxes are potential sound leak points - must be sealed
