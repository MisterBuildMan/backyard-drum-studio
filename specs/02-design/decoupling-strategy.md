## Acoustic Considerations

- Sound travels through solid connections more efficiently than through air
- Decoupling breaks the path: walls from floor, ceiling from walls, inner shell from outer shell
- Multiple decoupling strategies exist at different price/performance points
- Consistency matters - one weak link undermines the whole system
- Must balance decoupling with structural integrity
