## Roof Style

**Selection:** [ ] Gable  [ ] Shed  [ ] Flat  [ ] Hip

**Reasoning:** [TBD]

## Roof Assembly (top to bottom)

| Layer | Material | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Roofing | [TBD] | |
| Underlayment | [TBD] | |
| Sheathing | [TBD] | |
| Rafters/trusses | [TBD] | |
| Insulation | [TBD] | Minimum R-30 |

---

## Ceiling Assembly (if decoupled)

| Layer | Material | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Ceiling joists | [TBD] | |
| Decoupling method | [TBD] | Resilient channel, hat channel, or independent |
| Insulation | [TBD] | |
| Drywall | [TBD] | |

---

## Ceiling STC Estimate

**Target:** STC 55 (minimum, to match walls)

**Estimate:** [TBD]

---

## Acoustic Considerations

- Ceiling is often the weakest link in sound isolation (less mass than walls typically)
- Roof style affects interior ceiling options (vaulted vs. flat)
- Decoupled ceiling (resilient channel or independent joists) significantly improves STC
- Must handle Texas heat - adequate insulation and ventilation
- Simpler roof = easier DIY construction
