# Requirements: Design

## Introduction

This phase covers all design decisions for the drum studio structure before construction begins. The goal is to finalize dimensions, wall assemblies, soundproofing strategy, and all major building systems. These decisions will inform the permit application drawings and materials procurement.

## Glossary

- **STC (Sound Transmission Class):** Rating of how well a partition blocks airborne sound. Target: STC 55-60.
- **Wall Assembly:** The complete layered construction of a wall, including framing, insulation, sheathing, and finish materials.
- **Decoupling:** Physically separating building elements to prevent sound vibration transfer.
- **Flanking:** Sound that bypasses a barrier by traveling through adjacent structures.
- **Room-in-Room:** Construction where interior surfaces are isolated from the outer shell.

## Constraints (from Phase 1)

- **Maximum footprint:** 920 sq ft (after accounting for existing garage)
- **Setbacks:** 12 ft interior side, 25 ft rear (same as principal building)
- **Height:** Equal to principal building height
- **Budget:** [TBD - to be established in this phase]

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Determine Structure Dimensions

**Goal:** Establish final exterior and interior dimensions that meet functional needs, code requirements, and acoustic best practices.

**Reasoning:** 
- Acoustic drums need adequate space - minimum ~10×12 ft interior for a kit plus player movement
- Room proportions significantly affect acoustics - certain ratios minimize standing waves and flutter echo
- Wall thickness for sound isolation (~12" for double-stud) reduces interior space significantly
- Must stay within 920 sq ft footprint limit and setback requirements
- Ceiling height affects both acoustics and construction complexity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE exterior dimensions SHALL fit within the 920 sq ft available footprint
2. THE interior dimensions SHALL provide minimum 120 sq ft usable floor space
3. THE room proportions SHALL follow recommended acoustic ratios (avoid 1:1, 1:2, 2:3)
4. THE ceiling height SHALL be minimum 8 ft interior (9-10 ft preferred for acoustics)
5. THE Owner SHALL document both exterior and interior dimensions with wall thickness calculations

### Requirement 2: Select Wall Assembly System

**Goal:** Choose the wall construction method that balances sound isolation performance, cost, and DIY feasibility.

**Reasoning:** 
- Different wall systems achieve different STC ratings at different costs
- Options include: standard wood framing, double-stud walls, staggered-stud walls, concrete/CMU, SIPs
- Mass, decoupling, and damping all contribute to sound isolation
- DIY feasibility matters - some systems require specialized skills or equipment
- Texas climate requires consideration of thermal performance alongside acoustic

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Owner SHALL research and document at least 3 wall assembly options
2. EACH option SHALL include estimated STC rating, cost per sq ft, and DIY difficulty rating
3. THE selected wall assembly SHALL achieve minimum STC 55 (target STC 60)
4. THE selected wall assembly SHALL be feasible for DIY construction
5. THE Owner SHALL document the complete wall assembly layers from exterior to interior

---

### Requirement 3: Analyze Cost vs. Soundproofing Trade-offs

**Goal:** Create a decision matrix comparing construction approaches by cost, STC performance, and other factors.

**Reasoning:** 
- Higher STC ratings generally cost more (more mass, more layers, specialized materials)
- Diminishing returns exist - going from STC 50→55 is easier than STC 55→60
- Budget constraints may require prioritizing certain walls (e.g., neighbor-facing) over others
- Understanding trade-offs enables informed decisions rather than over/under-building

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Owner SHALL create a comparison matrix of wall assembly options
2. THE matrix SHALL include: STC rating, cost/sq ft, total wall cost, thermal R-value, thickness
3. THE Owner SHALL identify the "knee of the curve" where cost/benefit ratio changes
4. THE Owner SHALL document the selected approach with cost justification

---

### Requirement 4: Design Foundation System

**Goal:** Specify the foundation design that supports the structure and contributes to sound isolation.

**Reasoning:** 
- Drums create significant low-frequency energy that transmits through floors
- Standard slab-on-grade provides mass but couples to ground
- Floating slab (slab on isolation pads) can improve low-frequency isolation
- Foundation must support wall loads and any equipment
- Must account for Texas soil conditions (expansive clay common in Cedar Park area)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE foundation design SHALL support all structural loads
2. THE Owner SHALL evaluate floating slab vs. standard slab for acoustic benefit vs. cost
3. THE foundation design SHALL include appropriate vapor barrier and reinforcement
4. THE Owner SHALL document slab thickness, reinforcement, and any isolation details

---

### Requirement 5: Design Ceiling/Roof Assembly

**Goal:** Specify ceiling and roof construction that maintains sound isolation and handles Texas climate.

**Reasoning:** 
- Ceiling is often the weakest link in sound isolation (less mass than walls typically)
- Roof style affects interior ceiling options (vaulted vs. flat)
- Decoupled ceiling (resilient channel or independent joists) significantly improves STC
- Must handle Texas heat - adequate insulation and ventilation
- Simpler roof = easier DIY construction

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE ceiling assembly SHALL achieve STC rating comparable to walls (minimum STC 55)
2. THE roof design SHALL provide adequate thermal insulation (minimum R-30)
3. THE Owner SHALL evaluate decoupled ceiling options (resilient channel, hat channel, independent joists)
4. THE Owner SHALL document complete ceiling/roof assembly from interior finish to roofing

---

### Requirement 6: Plan Door and Window Strategy

**Goal:** Determine door and window specifications that don't compromise sound isolation.

**Reasoning:** 
- Doors and windows are typically the weakest points in any sound isolation system
- A wall is only as good as its weakest element
- Options: solid core door, double door (airlock), specialized acoustic door
- Windows: none, fixed double-pane, or specialized acoustic glazing
- Natural light vs. sound isolation trade-off
- Emergency egress requirements may mandate certain door/window specs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE door specification SHALL achieve minimum STC 45 (ideally matching wall STC)
2. IF windows are included, THEY SHALL achieve minimum STC 40
3. THE Owner SHALL evaluate door options: solid core, double door airlock, acoustic door
4. THE Owner SHALL decide on window inclusion with documented reasoning
5. THE Owner SHALL verify door/window specs meet egress requirements

---

### Requirement 7: Design HVAC System

**Goal:** Specify heating/cooling system that maintains comfort without compromising sound isolation.

**Reasoning:** 
- Texas climate requires HVAC - summer temps regularly exceed 100°F
- Ductwork is a major flanking path for sound
- Mini-split systems avoid ductwork but penetrate walls
- Any wall/ceiling penetration must be properly sealed and isolated
- Equipment noise (compressor, air handler) must be considered

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE HVAC system SHALL maintain interior temperature between 68-78°F
2. THE HVAC system SHALL not create flanking paths that reduce overall STC below target
3. THE Owner SHALL evaluate mini-split vs. ducted options with acoustic implications
4. THE Owner SHALL specify penetration sealing and isolation details
5. THE HVAC equipment noise level SHALL not exceed NC-25 inside the studio

---

### Requirement 8: Plan Electrical Layout

**Goal:** Design electrical system that supports studio use with adequate capacity and proper placement.

**Reasoning:** 
- Recording equipment has specific power requirements (clean power, adequate circuits)
- HVAC requires dedicated circuit(s)
- Outlet placement affects usability - drums, amps, recording gear locations
- Lighting needs: general, task, and potentially dimmable
- Future-proofing: extra capacity for equipment additions
- Electrical boxes are potential sound leak points

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE electrical service SHALL provide minimum 60A subpanel (100A preferred)
2. THE layout SHALL include dedicated circuits for: HVAC, recording equipment, general outlets
3. THE Owner SHALL specify outlet locations based on intended equipment placement
4. THE Owner SHALL specify lighting type and locations
5. ALL electrical penetrations SHALL be sealed to maintain sound isolation

---

### Requirement 9: Finalize Decoupling Strategy

**Goal:** Document the overall approach to preventing sound transmission through structural connections.

**Reasoning:** 
- Sound travels through solid connections more efficiently than through air
- Decoupling breaks the path: walls from floor, ceiling from walls, inner shell from outer shell
- Multiple decoupling strategies exist at different price/performance points
- Consistency matters - one weak link undermines the whole system
- Must balance decoupling with structural integrity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Owner SHALL document how walls connect to foundation (isolation pads, gaskets, or direct)
2. THE Owner SHALL document how ceiling connects to walls
3. THE Owner SHALL document any room-in-room construction details
4. THE decoupling strategy SHALL be consistent across all assemblies
5. THE Owner SHALL identify and address potential flanking paths

---

### Requirement 10: Establish Project Budget

**Goal:** Create a detailed budget estimate for the complete project based on design decisions.

**Reasoning:** 
- Design decisions directly impact cost
- Budget constraints may require design trade-offs
- Accurate estimates prevent mid-project surprises
- Should include contingency for unknowns
- Phased approach possible if budget is tight

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE budget SHALL itemize costs by category: foundation, framing, exterior, systems, interior, acoustic treatment
2. THE budget SHALL include materials and any contracted labor
3. THE budget SHALL include 15-20% contingency
4. THE Owner SHALL identify any areas where costs could be reduced if needed
5. THE total budget SHALL be approved before proceeding to construction

### Requirement 11: Create Construction Drawings

**Goal:** Produce drawings sufficient for permit application and construction.

**Reasoning:** 
- Cedar Park requires drawings for building permit
- Drawings ensure all design decisions are documented and coordinated
- Serves as reference during construction
- May use SketchUp for 3D model, plus 2D plans/sections/elevations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE drawings SHALL include: site plan, floor plan, elevations (4), wall sections, electrical plan
2. THE drawings SHALL show all dimensions and materials
3. THE drawings SHALL be sufficient for Cedar Park permit application
4. THE Owner SHALL create a 3D model (SketchUp) for visualization
