## Acoustic Considerations

- Doors and windows are typically the weakest points in any sound isolation system
- A wall is only as good as its weakest element
- Options: solid core door, double door (airlock), specialized acoustic door
- Windows: none, fixed double-pane, or specialized acoustic glazing
- Natural light vs. sound isolation trade-off
- Emergency egress requirements may mandate certain door/window specs
