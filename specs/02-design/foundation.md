## Foundation Type

**Selection:** [ ] Standard slab-on-grade  [ ] Floating slab  [ ] Other: ______

## Specifications

| Specification | Value | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Slab thickness | [TBD] | Typical: 4" residential, 6" for heavy loads |
| Reinforcement | [TBD] | #4 rebar grid, fiber mesh, or welded wire |
| Vapor barrier | [TBD] | 10-mil poly minimum |
| Gravel base | [TBD] | Typically 4" compacted |
| Edge detail | [TBD] | Thickened edge, turned-down edge, or stem wall |

## Floating Slab Details (if applicable)

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Isolation material | [TBD] |
| Isolation thickness | [TBD] |
| Perimeter gap | [TBD] |

## Acoustic Considerations

- Drums create significant low-frequency energy that transmits through floors
- Standard slab-on-grade provides mass but couples to ground
- Floating slab (slab on isolation pads) can improve low-frequency isolation
- Foundation must support wall loads and any equipment
- Must account for Texas soil conditions (expansive clay common in Cedar Park area)
