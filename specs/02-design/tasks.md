## Notes

- Tasks 1-3 (dimensions and wall assembly) should be completed first as they affect everything else
- HVAC sizing (Task 7) depends on final dimensions and insulation values
- Budget (Task 10) should be revisited after each major decision
- Drawings (Task 11) can be started once dimensions are set, refined as details are added
