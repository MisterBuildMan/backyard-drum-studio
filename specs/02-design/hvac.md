## Acoustic Considerations

- Texas climate requires HVAC - summer temps regularly exceed 100°F
- Ductwork is a major flanking path for sound
- Mini-split systems avoid ductwork but penetrate walls
- Any wall/ceiling penetration must be properly sealed and isolated
- Equipment noise (compressor, air handler) must be considered
- Target: NC-25 or lower inside the studio
