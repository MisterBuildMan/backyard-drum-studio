# Tasks: Planning & Permits

## Overview

Research Austin building codes, select the building site, determine structure size, and obtain all necessary permits before construction begins.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Research Cedar Park building codes
  - [x] 1.1 Look up property zoning district

  - [ ] 1.4 Calculate current impervious cover and limits
    - Measure existing structures, driveways, patios
    - _Requirements: 1.4_
  - [ ] 1.5 Research requirements for structures with electrical/HVAC

    - Consider setbacks, access, electrical proximity
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
  - [ ] 2.2 Measure distances from property lines for chosen site
    - _Requirements: 2.5_
  - [ ] 2.3 Assess ground conditions at chosen site
    - Check for slope, drainage, obstacles
    - _Requirements: 2.4_
  - [ ] 2.4 Verify concrete truck access path
    - _Requirements: 2.2_
  - [ ] 2.5 Document site selection in design.md
    - _Requirements: 2.5_

- [ ] 3. Determine structure size
  - [ ] 3.1 Calculate maximum footprint that fits setbacks
    - _Requirements: 3.3_
  - [ ] 3.2 Choose dimensions with good acoustic proportions
    - Avoid 1:1 or 1:2 ratios
    - _Requirements: 3.2_
  - [ ] 3.3 Verify minimum 120 sq ft interior space
    - Account for wall thickness (~12" for sound-isolated walls)
    - _Requirements: 3.1_
  - [ ] 3.4 Document preliminary dimensions in design.md
    - _Requirements: 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Checkpoint - Review before permit application
  - Verify all code research is complete
  - Confirm site selection meets all requirements
  - Confirm dimensions are finalized

- [ ] 5. Obtain building permit
  - [ ] 5.1 Gather required documents for permit application
    - Site plan, floor plan, elevations (may need Phase 2 design first)
    - _Requirements: 4.1_
  - [ ] 5.2 Submit building permit application
    - _Requirements: 4.2_
  - [ ] 5.3 Respond to any plan review comments
    - _Requirements: 4.3_
  - [ ] 5.4 Receive permit approval
    - Document permit number and conditions
    - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Obtain electrical permit
  - [ ] 6.1 Determine electrical requirements
    - Estimate amperage needs (HVAC, outlets, lighting)
    - _Requirements: 5.1_
  - [ ] 6.2 Submit electrical permit application
    - _Requirements: 5.2_
  - [ ] 6.3 Receive electrical permit approval
    - _Requirements: 5.3_

- [ ] 7. Document project scope
  - [ ] 7.1 Finalize and document structure dimensions
    - _Requirements: 6.1_
  - [ ] 7.2 Document site location with measurements
    - _Requirements: 6.2_
  - [ ] 7.3 Document permit numbers and conditions
    - _Requirements: 6.3_
  - [ ] 7.4 Document known constraints
    - _Requirements: 6.4_
  - [ ] 7.5 Document feature list (HVAC, electrical, sound isolation goals)
    - _Requirements: 6.5_

- [ ] 8. Final checkpoint - Phase 1 complete
  - All permits obtained
  - Site selected and documented
  - Dimensions finalized
  - Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Design

## Notes

- Tasks 5 and 6 (permits) may require preliminary designs from Phase 2
- Consider starting Phase 2 design work in parallel with permit applications
- Cedar Park permit processing times vary - check current estimates
