# Requirements: Planning & Permits

## Introduction

This phase covers all pre-construction planning: understanding local building codes, selecting the site, obtaining necessary permits, and establishing the project scope. This must be completed before any physical construction begins.

## Glossary

- **Setback:** Required minimum distance between a structure and property lines, per local zoning code.
- **Accessory Structure:** A secondary building on a residential property (detached from main house).
- **ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit):** A secondary living space - NOT what we're building, but relevant for code research.
- **Impervious Cover:** Surfaces that don't absorb water (roofs, concrete, etc.) - often limited by code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Understand Austin Building Codes

**Goal:** Research and document all applicable building codes and zoning requirements for a permanent accessory structure in Cedar Park, TX.

**Reasoning:** 
- Austin has specific rules for accessory structures that differ from the main dwelling
- Setback requirements vary by lot size and zoning district
- Impervious cover limits may affect where/how big we can build
- Understanding codes upfront prevents costly redesigns or permit denials

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Owner SHALL identify the property's zoning district
2. THE Owner SHALL document setback requirements (front, side, rear) for accessory structures
3. THE Owner SHALL document maximum height restrictions for accessory structures
4. THE Owner SHALL document impervious cover limits and current usage
5. THE Owner SHALL document any additional requirements for structures with electrical/HVAC

### Requirement 2: Select Building Site

**Goal:** Choose the optimal location in the backyard for the studio.

**Reasoning:** 
- Must comply with setback requirements
- Should minimize distance to electrical service
- Should consider drainage and ground conditions
- Sound travels - distance from neighbors matters
- Access for construction materials and equipment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Site SHALL comply with all setback requirements
2. THE Site SHALL be accessible for concrete truck delivery
3. THE Site SHALL have reasonable proximity to electrical panel
4. THE Site SHALL be on relatively level ground or require minimal grading
5. THE Owner SHALL document the chosen location with measurements from property lines

### Requirement 3: Determine Structure Size

**Goal:** Establish preliminary dimensions for the studio that meet both functional needs and code requirements.

**Reasoning:** 
- Acoustic drums need adequate space (minimum ~10x12 ft interior)
- Room proportions affect acoustics (avoid perfect squares/cubes)
- Size affects permit requirements and costs
- Must fit within setback constraints at chosen site

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Structure dimensions SHALL provide minimum 120 sq ft interior floor space
2. THE Structure proportions SHALL avoid 1:1 or 1:2 ratios (acoustic reasons)
3. THE Structure footprint SHALL fit within setback requirements at chosen site
4. THE Owner SHALL document preliminary exterior dimensions

---

### Requirement 4: Obtain Building Permit

**Goal:** Submit permit application and receive approval from City of Cedar Park.

**Reasoning:** 
- Permanent structures with electrical require permits in Cedar Park
- Unpermitted work can result in fines, forced removal, or issues selling property
- Permit process includes plan review that may catch design issues early
- Inspections during construction help ensure safety

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Owner SHALL prepare required permit application documents
2. THE Owner SHALL submit application to City of Cedar Park Development Services
3. THE Permit SHALL be approved before any construction begins
4. THE Owner SHALL document permit number and any conditions of approval

---

### Requirement 5: Obtain Electrical Permit

**Goal:** Obtain separate electrical permit for the studio's electrical system.

**Reasoning:** 
- Electrical work requires its own permit in Austin
- May need to coordinate with building permit
- Determines if subpanel is needed vs. extending existing circuits
- Required for final inspection

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Owner SHALL determine electrical service requirements (amperage, circuits)
2. THE Owner SHALL submit electrical permit application
3. THE Electrical Permit SHALL be approved before electrical rough-in begins

---

### Requirement 6: Document Project Scope

**Goal:** Create a clear project scope document that captures key decisions and constraints.

**Reasoning:** 
- Prevents scope creep during construction
- Provides reference for design phase
- Documents constraints discovered during planning
- Helps estimate overall project timeline

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Scope Document SHALL include confirmed structure dimensions
2. THE Scope Document SHALL include site location with measurements
3. THE Scope Document SHALL include permit numbers and conditions
4. THE Scope Document SHALL include known constraints (setbacks, utilities, access)
5. THE Scope Document SHALL include high-level feature list (HVAC, electrical, sound isolation goals)
