# Design: Planning & Permits

## Overview

This document captures the findings, decisions, and documentation gathered during the planning phase. It will be populated as research is completed and permits are obtained.

## Design Files

*No design files for this phase - see Phase 2: Design for SketchUp models.*

## Specifications

### Project Classification

This project is classified as an [**Accessory Building**](https://ecode360.com/38613780) per Cedar Park Code: *"An enclosed accessory structure with a roof, used or intended for supporting or sheltering a use."*

Note: "Accessory building" (enclosed with roof) differs from "accessory structure" (broader term including non-enclosed structures). Both terms appear in the setback table but have identical requirements for structures >180 sq ft.

This is NOT an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) since it will not contain sleeping accommodations, kitchen facilities, or plumbing.

### Property Information

**Address:** [To be documented]

**Zoning District:** SR (Suburban Residential)

**Lot Size:** ~0.3 acres

**Current Impervious Cover:** [To be measured - see calculation worksheet below]

---

### Setback Requirements

Per Cedar Park Code [§ 11.04.002](https://ecode360.com/38613286) - Accessory Building and Structure Standards:

**For accessory buildings > 180 sq ft** (which applies to this project):

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Interior Side Setback | Equal to principal building |
| Street Side Setback | Equal to principal building |
| Rear Setback | Equal to principal building |
| Street Side Rear Setback | Equal to principal building |
| Setback from Principal Building | Per IBC/IRC |

**Setback from Principal Building (IBC/IRC):** The Cedar Park code references IBC/IRC for the minimum separation between an accessory building and the principal dwelling. Note: Per [IRC R302.1](https://up.codes/s/exterior-wall-location), there is actually **no fire separation distance requirement** between a dwelling and accessory buildings on the same lot. The specific IBC/IRC section Cedar Park is referencing needs clarification - contact Development Services to confirm the exact requirement before finalizing site placement.

**Principal building setbacks for SR district** per [§ 11.03.061A](https://ecode360.com/38612850):

| Direction | Required Setback | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Front | 30 ft | |
| Rear | 25 ft | May reduce 5 ft to preserve heritage trees (admin approval) |
| Interior Side | 12 ft | |
| Street Side | 20 ft | For corner lots |

**For smaller accessory buildings (reference):**
- < 80 sq ft: 5 ft side/rear setbacks
- 81-180 sq ft: 5 ft interior side, 10 ft street side, 5 ft rear

**Additional notes:**
- Setbacks may be reduced up to 5 ft to preserve protected/heritage trees (requires administrator approval)
- Rear setbacks on double frontage lots = same as front setback (30 ft)
- Structures over 80 sq ft require a building permit per [§ 11.04.031](https://ecode360.com/38613288)

---

### Height Restrictions

Per Cedar Park Code [§ 11.04.002](https://ecode360.com/38613286) - Accessory Building and Structure Standards:

**For accessory buildings > 180 sq ft** (which applies to this project):
- Maximum height = Equal to principal building

**Principal building height for established neighborhoods:** Per [§ 11.03.033](https://ecode360.com/38612820) (Standards for Established Neighborhoods), principal buildings in existing platted subdivisions may be "constructed, redeveloped or expanded to the same dimensions of building height" as existing buildings. This means the height limit is based on your existing house height, not a fixed number.

**Practical implication:** Measure your existing house height to determine the maximum allowed height for the accessory building.

**For smaller accessory buildings (reference):**
- < 80 sq ft: 12 ft max height
- 81-180 sq ft: 15 ft max height

### Lot Coverage / Impervious Cover

**Definition:** Per Cedar Park Code [§ 14.07.002](https://ecode360.com/38625705), "Lot coverage" means "the impervious area of a lot, including but not limited to the area covered by parking spaces, driveways, sidewalks, rocked areas, and equipment pads located thereon."

### Accessory Building Coverage Limit

Per Cedar Park Code [§ 11.04.001(F)](https://ecode360.com/38613279) - Residential accessory building coverage:

> "The total of all accessory buildings cannot exceed **20 percent coverage of the back yard** of a single-family residence, and each accessory building shall not exceed the size of the principal building."

**This is the key constraint for the studio.**

#### Back Yard Coverage Calculation

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Back yard area** | ~6,600 sq ft (85×60 + 50×30, per Google Maps) |
| **20% maximum** | **1,320 sq ft** |
| Detached garage | 400 sq ft (20×20) |
| **Available for studio** | **920 sq ft** |

*Note: Measurements from Google Maps are approximate. Verify with physical measurement or survey for permit application.*

#### Additional Rules (§ 11.04.001(F)):
1. Sum of all accessory uses in principal building ≤ 25% of principal building gross floor area
2. Each accessory building ≤ size of principal building
3. For lots ≥ 5 acres: total accessory buildings ≤ 4,000 sq ft

**Note:** "Back yard" typically means the area behind the rear building line of the principal structure. Measure from the back of your house to the rear property line, between the side property lines.
