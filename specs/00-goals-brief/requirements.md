# Requirements: Goals & Brief

## Introduction

This phase establishes the foundational "why" for the project before any planning, permitting, or design work begins. Based on guidance from Soundman2020's studio design methodology, this document captures the project motivation, intended use, technical targets, and master checklist of considerations.

This is a living document - it will be updated as the project progresses and you learn more about what's realistic and what's needed.

## Reference

This spec is based on Soundman2020's "How to design and build your own recording studio" series:
- [Introduction and Steps 1-3](https://www.digistar.cl/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=707)
- Step 1: Define your goals
- Step 2: Figure out how to achieve your goals (master checklist)
- Step 3: Decide on how much isolation you need

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Project Motivation ("The Why")

**Goal:** Write a clear statement of why you want to build this studio and what motivated the decision.

**Reasoning:**
- Crystallizes your thinking before investing time and money
- Provides a reference point when making trade-off decisions later
- Helps prevent scope creep by anchoring to original intent
- Forces you to articulate what you actually need vs. what would be nice

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Brief SHALL answer: "Why do you want it?"
2. THE Brief SHALL answer: "What motivated your decision to make your own place?"
3. THE Brief SHALL answer: "Why is making your own place better than the alternatives?" (renting studio time, practice pads, converting existing room, etc.)

---

### Requirement 2: Document Intended Use ("A Typical Day")

**Goal:** Write a detailed description of what you imagine yourself doing in the studio on a typical day.

**Reasoning:**
- Drives decisions about room size, layout, and features
- Helps identify equipment and infrastructure needs
- Reveals whether your space constraints match your intended use
- Distinguishes between "must have" and "nice to have" features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Brief SHALL describe a typical session in detail (what instruments, how many people, what activities)
2. THE Brief SHALL describe the range of uses (practice only? recording? mixing? all of the above?)
3. THE Brief SHALL identify primary vs. secondary uses
4. THE Brief SHALL note any special requirements (e.g., video recording, live streaming, teaching)

---

### Requirement 3: Establish Technical Targets

**Goal:** Define objective, measurable technical specifications for the studio.

**Reasoning:**
- Subjective goals ("sounds good") can't be plugged into equations or looked up in tables
- Technical targets drive material selection, construction methods, and budget
- Provides acceptance criteria for the finished space
- Prevents under-building or over-building

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Brief SHALL specify an isolation target in decibels (dB TL), not STC
2. THE Brief SHALL specify desired room acoustic character (RT60 target, or subjective description like "tight," "warm," "neutral")
3. THE Brief SHALL specify any frequency response goals (if applicable)
4. THE Brief SHALL note any reference standards being targeted (e.g., ITU BS.1116-3 for control rooms)

---

### Requirement 4: Calculate Isolation Requirement

**Goal:** Determine the actual isolation needed through measurement, not guesswork.

**Reasoning:**
- "Enough to not annoy neighbors" is not a number you can design to
- Isolation needs depend on both sound going OUT and sound coming IN
- Drums are much louder than people think (105-115 dBC, not 80 dBA)
- Background noise levels vary by time of day and location

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Owner SHALL measure "How loud am I?" using a sound level meter set to C-weighting, Slow response
2. THE Owner SHALL measure typical drum playing levels (or reference typical values: 105-115 dBC)
3. THE Owner SHALL measure "How quiet do I need to be?" - background noise at studio location, at intended use times
4. THE Owner SHALL calculate isolation requirement: (Loud level) - (Background level) = Required isolation in dB
5. THE Brief SHALL document all measurements and the calculated isolation target

---

### Requirement 5: Document Timeline and Budget

**Goal:** Establish realistic expectations for project completion and investment.

**Reasoning:**
- Budget will always be higher than initial estimate (per Soundman2020: "The actual cost of building a studio is ALWAYS higher than you first imagined")
- Timeline affects decisions (rushing leads to mistakes)
- Written targets help with planning and prioritization
- Acknowledging these are estimates, not commitments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Brief SHALL include a target completion date (or date range)
2. THE Brief SHALL include an initial budget estimate (acknowledging it will likely increase)
3. THE Brief SHALL note any hard constraints (e.g., "must be done before summer," "cannot exceed $X")
4. THE Brief SHALL identify budget priorities (what to spend more on, what to economize on)

---

### Requirement 6: Complete Master Checklist (Initial Notes)

**Goal:** Document initial thoughts on each major consideration area, even if just "N/A" or "TBD."

**Reasoning:**
- Ensures nothing is overlooked before design begins
- Creates a reference document that will be refined throughout the project
- Forces consideration of items that first-time builders often miss (HVAC, electrical, lighting)
- Provides structure for the design phase

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. THE Checklist SHALL include notes on: Isolation (covered by Requirement 4)
2. THE Checklist SHALL include notes on: Dimensions (room size, proportions for modal response)
3. THE Checklist SHALL include notes on: Layout (where things go - doors, windows, equipment, instruments)
4. THE Checklist SHALL include notes on: Geometry (speaker/listening position relationships, if applicable)
5. THE Checklist SHALL include notes on: HVAC (required for isolated rooms - ducts, silencers, equipment location)
6. THE Checklist SHALL include notes on: Acoustic testing (plans for measuring room response)
7. THE Checklist SHALL include notes on: Acoustic treatment (desired room sound character)
8. THE Checklist SHALL include notes on: Electrical system (power needs, clean power for audio)
9. THE Checklist SHALL include notes on: Lighting (type, placement, mood/atmosphere)
10. THE Checklist SHALL include notes on: Decoration (colors, materials, aesthetic goals)

## Notes

- Expect to revise this document multiple times as you learn more
- Keep backups - this is your master reference
- Some answers may be "TBD" initially, but should be filled in before design phase
