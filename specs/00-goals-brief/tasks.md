# Tasks: Goals & Brief

## Overview

This phase produces the project brief document that captures motivation, intended use, technical targets, and the master checklist of considerations.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Write Project Motivation
  - [x] 1.1 Answer: "Why do you want to build this studio?"
  - [x] 1.2 Answer: "What motivated the decision to make your own place?"
  - [x] 1.3 Answer: "Why is building better than alternatives?" (renting studio time, practice pads, converting existing room, etc.)
  _Completed: 2026-01-25_

- [x] 2. Document Intended Use
  - [x] 2.1 Describe a typical session in detail (instruments, people, activities)
  - [x] 2.2 Describe the range of uses (practice, recording, mixing, etc.)
  - [x] 2.3 Identify primary vs. secondary uses
  - [x] 2.4 Note any special requirements (video, streaming, teaching, etc.)
  _Completed: 2026-01-25_

- [ ] 3. Calculate Isolation Requirement
  - [ ] 3.1 Acquire or borrow a sound level meter (C-weighting capable)
  - [ ] 3.2 Measure "How loud am I?" - drum kit at typical playing volume (~3 ft from kit, C-weighting, Slow)
  - [ ] 3.3 Measure "How quiet do I need to be?" - background noise at studio site, at intended use times
  - [ ] 3.4 Calculate: Source level - Background level = Required isolation (dB)
  - [ ] 3.5 Document all measurements and calculated target

- [ ] 4. Establish Technical Targets
  - [ ] 4.1 Document isolation target in dB (from Task 3)
  - [ ] 4.2 Define desired room acoustic character (RT60 target or subjective description)
  - [ ] 4.3 Note any frequency response goals (if applicable)
  - [ ] 4.4 Note any reference standards being targeted (if applicable)

- [ ] 5. Document Timeline and Budget
  - [ ] 5.1 Set target completion date (or date range)
  - [ ] 5.2 Set initial budget estimate (acknowledging it will likely increase)
  - [ ] 5.3 Note any hard constraints (deadlines, budget caps)
  - [ ] 5.4 Identify budget priorities (where to invest vs. economize)

- [ ] 6. Organize Project Structure for Master Checklist
  - Ensure the project specs and phases cover all consideration areas from Soundman2020's Step 2
  - Each item should have a home in the project structure (1:1 spec mapping or grouped into existing specs)
  - [ ] 6.1 Isolation - Verify coverage in project structure
  - [ ] 6.2 Dimensions - Verify coverage in project structure
  - [ ] 6.3 Layout - Verify coverage in project structure
  - [ ] 6.4 Geometry - Verify coverage in project structure
  - [ ] 6.5 HVAC - Verify coverage in project structure
  - [ ] 6.6 Acoustic Testing - Verify coverage in project structure
  - [ ] 6.7 Acoustic Treatment - Verify coverage in project structure
  - [ ] 6.8 Electrical - Verify coverage in project structure
  - [ ] 6.9 Lighting - Verify coverage in project structure
  - [ ] 6.10 Decoration - Verify coverage in project structure
  - [ ] 6.11 Update `master-plan.md` if new phases/specs are needed

- [ ] 7. Create Brief Document
  - [ ] 7.1 Create `specs/00-goals-brief/brief.md` with all sections
  - [ ] 7.2 Review for completeness
  - [ ] 7.3 Identify any items that need follow-up research

- [ ] 8. Update Project Documentation
  - [ ] 8.1 Update `master-plan.md` to include Phase 0
  - [ ] 8.2 Reconcile isolation target with existing `02-design` STC references
  - [ ] 8.3 Add Soundman2020 forum links to `resources.md`

## Notes

- Tasks 1, 2, 5 are primarily writing/reflection
- Task 3 requires physical measurements with equipment
- Task 6 items may remain "TBD" until later phases
- This is a living document - expect revisions as the project progresses
