# Project Brief: Backyard Drum Studio

This document captures the foundational "why" for the project, establishing goals and targets before design and construction begin.

---

## 1. Project Motivation

### Why Build This Studio?

I play and record acoustic drums—a craft I've pursued since age 13. I've always wanted a dedicated space of my own. While I've had a home studio before (built into a rented basement), I now own my home and want a permanent place to practice and record.

The studio must provide sufficient sound isolation to:
- Allow playing without disturbing family inside the house
- Prevent noise complaints from neighbors
- Enable practice sessions at reasonable hours without restrictions

### What Motivated the Decision?

Several factors drove this decision:

- **Eliminating overhead costs** — Renting rehearsal spaces means ongoing monthly fees just to practice
- **Eliminating travel time** — Driving to rental spaces cuts into limited free time
- **Mental health benefit** — Playing drums is meditative and calming; having immediate access at home is paramount
- **Control over the space** — I want to customize and decorate to my needs, not adapt to someone else's setup
- **Gear security** — My drum kit and recording equipment are expensive; I don't want to leave them at a rental facility

### Why Building Is Better Than Alternatives

| Alternative | Why It Doesn't Work |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Renting studio time** | Expensive and inconvenient for regular practice |
| **Short-term rehearsal spaces** | Subpar gear, no recording capability |
| **Long-term rehearsal spaces** | Expensive, hard to find, still requires travel |
| **Converting existing room** | No spare rooms available; even with treatment, some sound will leak through and disturb family and pets in the house |
| **Practice pads / electronic kit** | Not the same as acoustic drums for feel and recording |

**The opportunity:** I have a sizable backyard where a new structure can be built from scratch with proper isolation designed in from the start.

## 2. Intended Use

### A Typical Session

A typical session is 1-3 hours of playing along to favorite tracks. Occasionally this includes working through online courses or lessons. Some sessions are practice-pad only, focusing on fundamentals.

**Occupancy:** Usually solo (95% of the time). Occasional musician may join for a jam session.

### Kit Setup

5-piece acoustic drum kit:
- **Snares:** 12" piccolo or 14" (multiple snares, swap as needed)
- **Toms:** 10", 12", 14"
- **Bass drum:** 20"
- **Cymbals:** 15" hi-hats, 17" crash, 19" crash, 21" ride, 19" china, 9" splash

### Range of Uses

| Use | Frequency | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| **Drum practice** | Primary | Playing along to tracks, fundamentals |
| **Recording** | Regular | Tracking drums for collaborations (send tracks to others) |
| **Video recording** | Regular | Recording sessions for social media content |
| **Mixing** | Regular | Same PC/monitors used for recording and office work |
| **Jamming with others** | Occasional | Not primary use case |

### Primary vs. Secondary Uses

**Primary:**
1. Acoustic drum practice (3-4x/week target)
2. Recording drum tracks
3. Video recording of sessions

**Secondary:**
1. Home office (desk, PC workstation, monitors)
2. Mixing/editing
3. Couch + TV (leisure)

Drums drive all design decisions. Secondary uses must fit around the primary purpose.

### Special Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Video recording** | Need space for lighting and camera setup; content for social media |
| **PC workstation** | Recording interface, monitors, mixing — same setup serves as home office |
| **Playback system** | Studio monitors for mixing; need to accommodate in room layout |
| **Live streaming** | Not required |
| **Teaching** | Not required |

### Current Status
- On hiatus for ~9 months due to lack of space
- Previously had a long-term rehearsal rental, gave it up when purchasing home
- Acoustic kit cannot be set up in current house without noise complaints
