# Project Brief: Backyard Drum Studio

This document captures the foundational "why" for the project, establishing goals and targets before design and construction begin.

---

## 1. Project Motivation

### Why Build This Studio?

I play and record acoustic drums—a craft I've pursued since age 13. I've always wanted a dedicated space of my own. While I've had a home studio before (built into a rented basement), I now own my home and want a permanent place to practice and record.

The studio must provide sufficient sound isolation to:
- Allow playing without disturbing family inside the house
- Prevent noise complaints from neighbors
- Enable practice sessions at reasonable hours without restrictions

### What Motivated the Decision?

Several factors drove this decision:

- **Eliminating overhead costs** — Renting rehearsal spaces means ongoing monthly fees just to practice
- **Eliminating travel time** — Driving to rental spaces cuts into limited free time
- **Mental health benefit** — Playing drums is meditative and calming; having immediate access at home is paramount
- **Control over the space** — I want to customize and decorate to my needs, not adapt to someone else's setup
- **Gear security** — My drum kit and recording equipment are expensive; I don't want to leave them at a rental facility

### Why Building Is Better Than Alternatives

| Alternative | Why It Doesn't Work |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Renting studio time** | Expensive and inconvenient for regular practice |
| **Short-term rehearsal spaces** | Subpar gear, no recording capability |
| **Long-term rehearsal spaces** | Expensive, hard to find, still requires travel |
| **Converting existing room** | No spare rooms available; even with treatment, some sound will leak through and disturb family and pets in the house |
| **Practice pads / electronic kit** | Not the same as acoustic drums for feel and recording |

**The opportunity:** I have a sizable backyard where a new structure can be built from scratch with proper isolation designed in from the start.

## 2. Intended Use

*[To be completed in Task 2]*

### Primary Use
- **Acoustic drum practice** — Target frequency: 3-4 sessions per week minimum
- **Recording** — Capturing drum tracks for personal projects and collaborations (virtual and occasional live sessions)

### Secondary Use
- **Home office** — Space for desk, PC workstation, and potentially a couch + TV
- This is a distant secondary goal; drums remain the primary driver of all design decisions

### Current Status
- On hiatus for ~9 months due to lack of space
- Previously had a long-term rehearsal rental, gave it up when purchasing home
- Acoustic kit cannot be set up in current house without noise complaints

## 5. Master Checklist

*[To be completed in Task 6]*

Initial notes on each consideration area:

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Isolation | TBD | Primary requirement — must not disturb family or neighbors |
| Dimensions | TBD | Must fit drum kit + recording position + secondary office use |
| Layout | TBD | |
| Geometry | TBD | |
| HVAC | Required | Texas climate demands climate control |
| Acoustic Testing | TBD | |
| Acoustic Treatment | TBD | |
| Electrical | TBD | |
| Lighting | TBD | |
| Decoration | TBD | |
