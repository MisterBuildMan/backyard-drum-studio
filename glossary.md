# Glossary

Construction and acoustic terminology used in this project.

---

## Acoustic Terms

**STC (Sound Transmission Class)**
A rating of how well a building partition (wall, floor, ceiling) attenuates airborne sound. Higher is better. STC 50 means a 100dB sound is reduced to ~50dB on the other side.

**Decoupling**
Physically separating building elements to prevent sound vibration transfer. Example: double stud walls with an air gap.

**Flanking**
Sound that bypasses a barrier by traveling through adjacent structures (floors, ceilings, ducts). The weak link in sound isolation.

**Mass Loaded Vinyl (MLV)**
Dense, flexible material used to add mass to walls for sound blocking without adding thickness.

**Green Glue**
Viscoelastic damping compound applied between drywall layers to convert sound energy to heat.

**Room-Within-a-Room**
Construction technique where interior surfaces are isolated from the outer structure. Gold standard for sound isolation.

## Foundation Terms

**Slab-on-Grade**
Concrete slab poured directly on the ground, serving as both foundation and floor.

**Rebar**
Steel reinforcing bars placed in concrete to add tensile strength.

**Vapor Barrier**
Plastic sheeting placed under concrete to prevent moisture from wicking up through the slab.

**Curing**
The chemical process of concrete hardening. Requires moisture and time (typically 7-28 days for full strength).

---

## Framing Terms

**Stud**
Vertical framing member in a wall, typically 2x4 or 2x6 lumber.

**Plate**
Horizontal framing member at top (top plate) or bottom (sole plate) of a wall.

**On Center (OC)**
Measurement from the center of one stud to the center of the next. Standard is 16" OC.

**Header**
Horizontal beam above doors/windows that transfers load around the opening.

**Sheathing**
Panels (plywood, OSB) attached to exterior of framing for structural rigidity.

---

## Insulation Terms

**R-Value**
Measure of thermal resistance. Higher R-value = better insulation. R-19 is common for 2x6 walls.

**Batt Insulation**
Pre-cut sections of fiberglass or mineral wool insulation sized to fit between studs.

**Rigid Foam**
Dense foam boards (XPS, EPS, polyiso) used for continuous insulation.

---

## Electrical Terms

**Rough-In**
Installing electrical boxes and running wires before drywall goes up.

**Circuit**
A complete path for electrical current, protected by a breaker.

**Subpanel**
Secondary electrical panel fed from the main panel, useful for outbuildings.

---

## General Construction

**Permit**
Official approval from local building department to perform construction work.

**Inspection**
Review by building inspector at key stages (foundation, framing, electrical, final).

**Code**
Building regulations that specify minimum standards for construction.

**Setback**
Required distance between a structure and property lines, per local zoning.
